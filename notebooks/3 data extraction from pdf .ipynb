However, optimizing these systems often requires laborintensive, manual adjustments to refine roles, tasks, and interactions. This paper introduces a framework for autonomously optimizing Agentic AI solutions across industries, such as NLPdriven enterprise applications. The system employs agents for Refinement, Execution, Evaluation, Modification, and Documentation, leveraging iterative feedback loops powered by an LLM (*Llama 3.2-3B*). The framework achieves optimal performance without human input by autonomously generating and testing hypotheses to improve system configurations. This approach enhances scalability and adaptability, offering a robust solution for real-world applications in dynamic environments. Case studies across diverse domains illustrate the transformative impact of this framework, showcasing significant improvements in output quality, relevance, and actionability. All data for these case studies, including original and evolved agent codes, along with their outputs, are here: [anonymous.4open.science/r/evolver-1D11/](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/evolver-1D11/)\\n\\n### 1 Introduction\\n\\nAgentic AI systems, composed of specialized agents working collaboratively to achieve complex objectives, have transformed industries such as market research, business process optimization, and product recommendation. These systems excel in automating decision-making and streamlining workflows. However, their optimization remains challenging due to the complexity of agent interactions and reliance on manual configurations.\\n\\nRecent advancements in large language models (LLMs) provide a solution by enabling automated refinement of Agentic AI systems. LLMs can autonomously generate and evaluate complex hypotheses, facilitating iterative improvements in\\n\\nagent roles and workflows with minimal human oversight. Case studies conducted demonstrate how these advancements address domain-specific challenges. These examples highlight the framework\\'s scalability and adaptability, making it particularly effective for dynamic, evolving environments.\\n\\nThis paper presents a framework for autonomous optimization of Agentic AI systems using LLMpowered feedback loops. The framework improves efficiency and scalability by refining agent configurations based on qualitative and quantitative metrics. Several case studies across various domains provide evidence of the framework\\'s ability to overcome domain-specific challenges. Designed for deployment in enterprise systems, this framework addresses persistent challenges in optimizing complex workflows in real-world settings.\\n\\nThis work establishes a scalable, autonomous system for optimizing Agentic AI with broad applicability across industries. Key contributions:\\n\\n- Evolutionary Optimization: Evolving agent configurations without manual intervention.\\n- Autonomous Refinement: Fully automated optimization through iterative feedback loops.\\n- Validation Case Studies: Empirical results from case studies in diverse domains, demonstrating significant performance gains.\\n\\n### 2 Background\\n\\nAgentic AI systems automate complex processes across industries, providing significant efficiency gains. However, their optimization requires addressing the intricacies of agent interactions, particularly in dynamic environments with evolving objectives. Recent advancements in LLMs offer transformative capabilities by enabling autonomous generation and evaluation of hypotheses to improve workflows. This framework distinguishes itself by enabling fully autonomous optimization of Agentic\\n\\n1\\n\\nAI systems. The system enhances scalability, adaptability, and domain independence through LLMdriven feedback loops, hypothesis generation, and iterative modifications, setting a new standard for optimizing complex AI workflows. Unlike previous approaches reliant on predefined tasks or manual intervention, this method offers a superior solution for real-world, dynamic environments.\\n\\nPrior research has explored various aspects of agentic systems\\' optimization and LLM integration. For instance, [Huang et al.](#page-8-0) [\\\\(2024\\\\)](#page-8-0) introduced *MLAgentBench*, a benchmark for evaluating language agents across diverse tasks. While this framework provides valuable insights, it focuses primarily on performance evaluation rather than iterative workflow refinement, which is our study\\'s focus. Similarly, [Smith et al.](#page-8-1) [\\\\(2023\\\\)](#page-8-1) explored the use of *Large Model Agents (LMAs)* to enhance cooperation between agents using LLMs, highlighting the potential of LLMs for iterative feedback loops among agents. This aligns closely with the current study\\'s emphasis on autonomous refinement processes.\\n\\n[Johnson and Liu](#page-8-2) [\\\\(2023\\\\)](#page-8-2) demonstrated how LLMs enable agents to autonomously refine their roles and workflows, underscoring the significance of optimizing agentic AI systems. Meanwhile, [Pan](#page-8-3) [and Zhang](#page-8-3) [\\\\(2024\\\\)](#page-8-3) proposed using automated evaluators to refine agent performance in tasks like web navigation. While effective in that domain, it lacks the scalability and domain independence targeted by the current framework. Similarly, [Wang](#page-8-4) [et al.](#page-8-4) [\\\\(2024\\\\)](#page-8-4) introduced an LLM-based skill discovery framework, resonating with the iterative task proposals discussed in this study. Furthermore, [Hu](#page-8-5) [et al.](#page-8-5) [\\\\(2024\\\\)](#page-8-5) emphasized the importance of modular components and foundational models for planning and executing agentic systems, focusing on the design phase, whereas the current study emphasizes continuous refinement and workflow optimization.\\n\\n[Masterman et al.](#page-8-6) [\\\\(2024\\\\)](#page-8-6) reviewed emerging AI agent architectures, focusing on modularity and scalability, which are central to this framework\\'s refinement approach. [Mitra et al.](#page-8-7) [\\\\(2024\\\\)](#page-8-7) proposed a framework for generating synthetic data with agents, showcasing their potential to refine outputs via feedback loops. [Yu et al.](#page-8-8) [\\\\(2024\\\\)](#page-8-8) introduced the *Reflective Tree* for multistep decision-making, aligning with this study\\'s iterative design. [Pan et al.](#page-8-9) [\\\\(2024\\\\)](#page-8-9) addressed feedback loop risks like reward hacking, which this framework mitigates through robust evaluation. Finally, [Miller et al.](#page-8-10) [\\\\(2024\\\\)](#page-8-10) emphasized agent benchmarks, reinforcing this framework\\'s focus on qualitative metrics.\\n\\nRecently, Automated Design of Agentic Systems (ADAS) was introduced by [Hu et al.](#page-8-5) [\\\\(2024\\\\)](#page-8-5), focusing on creating new agentic designs through a metaagent that programs novel agents by combining and refining building blocks. While ADAS is designed to invent new agents, the framework presented in this study is focused on optimizing existing agent systems. Through iterative LLM-driven feedback loops, agent roles, tasks, and workflows are refined to enhance adaptability and scalability in dynamic environments. Unlike ADAS, which prioritizes agent creation, this work focuses on continuously improving and optimizing established systems.\\n\\n|  |  | Algorithm 1 Agentic AI Refinement Process |\\n|--|--|-------------------------------------------|\\n|--|--|-------------------------------------------|\\n\\n### 1: Input:\\n\\n- 2: C0: Initial code\\n- 3: criteria: Qualitative evaluation criteria\\n- 4: ϵ: Improvement threshold\\n- 5: max\\\\_iterations: Maximum number of iterations\\n\\n#### 6: Output:\\n\\n- 7: Cbest: Best-known code variant\\n- 8: Obest: Output of the best-known code variant\\n\\n#### 9: Initialization:\\n\\n- 10: Cbest ← C<sup>0</sup>\\n- 11: Obest ← execute(C0)\\n- 12: Sbest ← f(Obest, criteria)\\n- 13: iteration ← 0\\n- 14: while iteration < max\\\\_iterations do\\n- 15: iteration ← iteration + 1\\n- 16: Ebest ← evaluate(Obest, criteria)\\n- 17: H<sup>i</sup> ← generate\\\\_hypotheses(Ebest)\\n- 18: Ci+1 ← M(H<sup>i</sup> , Cbest)\\n- 19: Oi+1 ← execute(Ci+1)\\n- 20: Si+1 ← f(Oi+1, criteria)\\n- 21: if Si+1 > Sbest then\\n\\n$$\\nC_{\\\\text{best}} \\\\leftarrow C_{i+1}\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\nO_{\\\\text{best}} \\\\leftarrow O_{i+1}\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\n24: \\\\t S_{\\\\text{best}} \\\\leftarrow S_{i+1}\\n$$\\n\\n25: Save best-known variant and output\\n\\n### 26: end if\\n\\n- 27: if |Si+1 − Sbest| < ϵ then\\n- 28: break ▷ Stop if improvement is below threshold\\n- 29: end if\\n- 30: end while\\n- 31: Return Cbest, Obest\\n\\n### 3 Architecture\\n\\nThe proposed method for autonomous refinement and optimization of Agentic AI systems leverages several specialized agents, each responsible for a specific phase in the refinement process. This method operates in iterative cycles, continuously refining agent roles, goals, tasks, workflows, and dependencies based on qualitative and quantitative output evaluation. Moreover, the system is designed with scalability, ensuring its deployment across industries. The LLM-driven feedback loops offer a foundational infrastructure for adapting the system to various NLP applications, ensuring broad applicability across domains. The proposed method\\'s optimization process is guided by two core frameworks: the Synthesis Framework and the Evaluation Framework. Synthesis Framework framework generates hypotheses based on the system\\'s output. The Hypothesis Agent and Modification Agent collaborate to synthesize new configurations for the Agentic AI system, proposing modifications to agent roles, goals, and tasks; to be tested by the Evaluation Framework.\\n\\nThe refinement and optimization process is structured into these frameworks, contributing to the continuous improvement of the Agentic AI solution. The proposed method operates autonomously, iterating through cycles of hypothesis generation, execution, evaluation, and modification until optimal performance is achieved. A detailed report of a refinement iteration is provided in Appendix [A.](#page-8-11) This method begins by deploying a baseline version of the Agentic AI system. Agents are assigned predefined roles, tasks, and workflows, and the system generates initial qualitative and quantitative criteria based on the system\\'s objectives. An LLM is used to analyze the system\\'s code and extract evaluation metrics, which serve as benchmarks for assessing future outputs. Human input can be introduced to revise or fine-tune the evaluation criteria to better align with project goals; which is optional, as the method is designed to operate autonomously.\\n\\nThe proposed method begins with a baseline version of the Agentic AI system, assigning initial agent roles, goals, and workflows. The first execution is run to generate the initial output and establish the baseline for comparison. After evaluating the initial output, the Hypothesis Agent generates hypotheses for modifying agent roles, tasks, or workflows based on the evaluation feedback. These hypotheses are then passed to the Modification Agent, which synthesizes changes to agent logic, interactions, or dependencies, producing new system variants. The Execution Agent executes the newly modified versions of the system, and performance metrics are gathered. The outputs generated are evaluated using qualitative and quantitative criteria (e.g., clarity, relevance, execution time). The Selection Agent compares the newly generated outputs against the best-known variant, ranks the variants, and determines whether the new output is superior. Memory Module stores The best-performing variants for future iterations. The cycle repeats as the proposed method continues refining the agentic workflows, improving overall performance until predefined or generated (and optionally revised) criteria are satisfied.\\n\\n#### 3.1 Synthesis Framework\\n\\nThe Refinement Agent manages the iterative optimization process by delegating tasks to other agents and synthesizing hypotheses for improving the system. It evaluates agent outputs against qualitative and quantitative criteria, identifying areas where agent roles, tasks, or workflows can be improved. The Refinement Agent leverages evaluation metrics such as clarity, relevance, depth of analysis, and actionability to propose modifications that enhance system output. The Hypothesis Generation Agent proposes specific changes to the agent system based on the output analysis. This module generates hypotheses for improving agent roles, tasks, and interactions based on evaluation feedback. For example, if agents are underperforming due to inefficiencies in their task delegation, the hypothesis module might suggest altering task hierarchies or reassigning specific roles.\\n\\nThe Modification Agent implements changes based on the hypotheses generated by the Refinement Agent. These changes may involve adjusting agent logic, modifying workflows, or altering agent dependencies. By synthesizing these changes, our method creates multiple variants of the Agentic AI solution. Each variant is stored and documented, with details regarding the expected improvements. The Execution Agent runs modified versions of the system, executing the newly generated variants and collecting performance data for subsequent evaluation. It ensures that agents perform their tasks as specified in the new configuration and debug issues as they arise. The Execution Agent tracks qualitative and quantitative outputs, feeding this information into the evaluation process.\\n\\n#### 3.2 Evaluation Framework\\n\\nThe Evaluation Framework is responsible for assessing the outputs of each system variant. The Evaluation Agent employs Llama 3.2-3B to evaluate both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the system\\'s performance. The Evaluation Framework ensures that each iteration aligns with the system\\'s overarching objectives, focusing on continuous improvement. The Evaluation Agent assesses the outputs of each system variant using a LLM. The LLM evaluates outputs based on predefined or generated qualitative criteria, including clarity, relevance to the task, depth of analysis, actionability, and quantitative metrics such as execution time and success rate. The Evaluation Agent provides a comprehensive system performance analysis, identifying areas for further improvement. After each iteration, the Selection Agent compares the outputs of the modified system against the best-known configuration. It ranks the new variants based on the evaluation scores provided by the Evaluation Agent, determining which configuration yields the highest performance. The top-ranked variant is stored for future iterations, ensuring continuous improvement.\\n\\n#### 3.3 Refinement Process\\n\\nAgentic AI refinement process begins with the initialization of the best-known code variant, denoted as C0, and the generation of its corresponding output, OC<sup>0</sup> . The performance of the output is evaluated using a set of qualitative criteria (e.g., clarity, relevance, depth of analysis), where the evaluation function f(OC, criteria) produces a score S(C0) = f(OC<sup>0</sup> , criteria) based on these criteria. This initial score, S(C0), is the baseline for comparison in subsequent iterations. At each iteration i, the current best-known output, OC<sup>i</sup> , is evaluated, and a set of hypotheses, H<sup>i</sup> = generate\\\\_hypotheses(EC<sup>i</sup> ), is generated from the qualitative evaluation EC<sup>i</sup> to suggest improvements. The hypotheses H<sup>i</sup> are then applied to the code C<sup>i</sup> , resulting in a new variant Ci+1 = M(H<sup>i</sup> , Ci). The new code variant Ci+1 is executed, producing a new output OCi+1 . The new output is evaluated using the same evaluation function f(OC, criteria), yielding a new score Si+1 = f(OCi+1 , criteria). If the new score Si+1 is greater than the best-known score Sbest = max(Si+1, Sbest), the new variant is considered superior, and the best-known variant is updated as follows. The process continues iteratively until a stopping condition is met, either when the\\n\\nimprovement between iterations becomes smaller than a predefined threshold |Si+1 − Sbest| < ϵ, or when a maximum number of iterations is reached. Upon termination, the proposed method returns the best-known variant Cbest and its output Obest.\\n\\nOnce initialized, the proposed method enters the execution phase, where agents perform their assigned tasks according to the baseline configuration. The Execution Agent runs the system, producing initial outputs that serve as a baseline for comparison in subsequent iterations. The results of this execution phase are stored for future analysis and comparison. The Evaluation Agent evaluates the outputs produced in the execution phase. The proposed method employs qualitative and quantitative criteria to assess the quality of the outputs. Qualitative metrics include relevance, clarity, depth of analysis, and actionability, while quantitative metrics include execution time, task completion rate, and overall system efficiency. The Evaluation Agent uses an LLM to generate detailed feedback, identifying areas where the system can be improved. The Hypothesis Generation Agent analyzes the evaluation data, generating hypotheses for improving agent roles, tasks, and workflows. These hypotheses may include changes such as altering task delegation, modifying agent goals, or restructuring the interdependencies between agents. Once the hypotheses are generated, the Modification Agent implements the proposed changes, creating new system variants based on these modifications. The modified versions of the system are re-executed by the Execution Agent, and the Evaluation Agent again evaluates their outputs. This iterative process continues, with each new variant compared against the previous best-known configuration. The Selection Agent ranks the system variants based on performance, ensuring that the Memory Module only stores the top-performing versions.\\n\\n## 4 Case Studies\\n\\nThe evolution of agent systems in various domains highlights the need for continuous refinement to meet the dynamic demands of industry standards and user expectations.

Each system\\'s evolution resulted in substantial improvements across various evaluation criteria, including alignment, accuracy, relevance, clarity, and actionability. These enhancements not only addressed the initial challenges faced by the original systems but also positioned the evolved agent systems as valuable tools for their respective domains. The experiments conducted across these diverse case studies underscore the necessity for continuous refinement in agent systems to meet the evolving needs of industries and users. Introducing specialized roles and a user-centric design focus have proven instrumental in enhancing output quality and effectiveness. The insights gained from case studies will serve as a basis for future agent systems, emphasizing the importance of specialization and adaptability in achieving optimal results. A critical insight from [Sulc et al.](#page-8-12) [\\\\(2024\\\\)](#page-8-12) is the importance of self-improving agents that adjust roles and interactions autonomously via feedback loops. Experiment results demonstrate the potential for dynamic adaptation and continuous enhancement, making it well-suited for environments with evolving objectives and conditions.\\n\\n### 6 Conclusion\\n\\nThis paper presents a robust method for the autonomous refinement and optimization of Agentic AI solutions. The presented method continuously improves agent-based workflows by leveraging iterative feedback loops, hypothesis generation, and automated modifications, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness. The proposed method\\'s autonomous nature minimizes human intervention, making it ideal for large-scale applications that require ongoing refinement. The method\\'s scalability, flexibility, and ability to adapt to evolving objectives make it a powerful tool for optimizing complex AI agents.\\n\\nWhile this method demonstrates promising advancements in Agentic AI, several avenues for future exploration could further enhance its capabilities. Investigating the role of human-in-the-loop strategies can bridge fully autonomous operations and scenarios where nuanced human judgment may be beneficial, especially during the initial deployment or in environments with high uncertainty. This could lead to hybrid systems where human expertise augments autonomous agent decisionmaking, ensuring safety and reliability without compromising autonomy. Collaborations with industry partners will also help tailor the method to real-world needs, ensuring adaptability and impact.\\n\\n### 7 Limitations\\n\\nThe proposed framework for the autonomous refinement of Agentic AI systems has certain limitations that warrant consideration. Using LLMs for feedback, hypothesis formation, and evaluation may lead to inaccuracies, lack of explainability, and biases stemming from their training data. The framework\\'s effectiveness relies on well-defined evaluation criteria. Poor or biased criteria can result in suboptimal refinements, as agents cannot independently identify missing dimensions. Minimal human involvement can be problematic in highstakes or ambiguous tasks, where nuanced judgment and ethical considerations, such as privacy or unintended consequences, are crucial. Iterative processes like hypothesis generation and evaluation are computationally intensive, potentially limiting adoption in resource-constrained settings.\\n\\n### References\\n\\n- <span id=\"page-8-5\"></span>Shengran Hu, Cong Lu, and Jeff Clune. 2024.
