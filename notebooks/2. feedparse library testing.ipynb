Existing proprietary models and APIs in\\nthe enterprise are mapped to 'agents', defined in an 'agent registry' that\\nserves agent metadata and learned representations for search and planning.\\nAgents can utilize proprietary data through a 'data registry' that similarly\\nregisters enterprise data of various modalities. Tying it all together, data\\nand task 'planners' break down, map, and optimize tasks and queries for given\\nquality of service (QoS) requirements such as cost, accuracy, and latency. We\\nillustrate an implementation of the architecture for a use-case in the HR\\ndomain and discuss opportunities and challenges for 'agentic AI' in the\\nenterprise.\"},\n",

This paper presents the\\nfirst comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying their\\nresource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power\\nconsumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling\\nstrategies.
